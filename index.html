    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a driven and passionate individual with a profound enthusiasm for astronomy and astrophysics, nurtured since childhood and 
        further solidified through academic and practical exposure to observational techniques such as gamma and radio astronomy. My 
        interests extend to high-energy physics, dark matter research, and the potential contributions of radio astronomy to 
        understanding fundamental cosmic phenomena. Academically, I have consistently excelled, graduating from King Edward VII School 
        with distinctions and maintaining outstanding results at university. Beyond academics, I actively 
        engage in leadership, music, and sports, having served as a pipe major in my schoolâ€™s band, represented my school in community 
        initiatives, and competed in cycling events. Additionally, I am the COO and co-majority shareholder of Shinrin AI Solutions (PTY) Ltd, an AI consulting agency, blending
         my technological expertise with entrepreneurial vision. Fluent in English and French, I am dedicated to continuous learning, 
         personal growth, and contributing meaningfully to both science and society.
